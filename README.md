# Wine-Quality-Prediction-Regression
This is a machine learning project which I've written an unpublished paper about. The task here is to predict wine quality using several indicators and make a regression prediction based off of it.

Models:
 - Random Forest
 - XGBoost
 - TabNet

Result:

Random forest achieved the best result here. This research is mainly focused on examining the effect of SMOTE in an imbalanced dataset, especially in regression tasks on a wine quality dataset.

This code is made in Google Collaboratory and uses Google Drive as a source for the input data. You can therefore just upload the dataset that I've given to your respective Google Drive in the same path as in the code or modify the input code so that it takes in the dataset via other means

# HOW TO RUN
1. Upload the dataset to your Google Drive in this path "/content/drive/MyDrive/winequalityN.csv" or modify the code to allow other means of getting the dataset in the code
2. Run, enjoy :)
